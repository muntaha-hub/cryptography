How to Use the Project

    Run the Script:
        Save the script to a file named cryptography_project.py.
        Open a terminal or command prompt.
        Navigate to the directory containing cryptography_project.py.
        Run the script with the command python cryptography_project.py.

    Input a Sentence:
        The program will prompt you to enter a sentence. Type your sentence and press Enter.

    Encryption:
        The program will generate a secret key and encrypt the sentence.
        It will display the encrypted (cipher) text and the secret key.

    Decryption:
        The program will ask if you want to decrypt the message. Type yes and press Enter.
        Enter the cipher text and the secret key when prompted.
        The program will decrypt the text and display the original sentence.
